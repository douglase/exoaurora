There are strange things done in the midnight sun<br>
By the men who moil for gold; <br>
The Arctic trails have their secret tales <br>
That would make your blood run cold; <br>
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights, <br>
But the queerest they ever did see <br>
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge <br>
I cremated Sam McGee.<br>
